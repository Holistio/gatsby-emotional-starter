# gatsby-emotional-starter

A simple [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) starter using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh) for styling and a few other packages - like Typography - that often come in handy.

It's not quite that emotional, but if you can't see through the tears you should consult the [Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
